To integrate **ELK (Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana)** with a **Spring Boot** application, you can follow these steps. The goal is to set up logging with Elasticsearch for storing logs, Logstash for processing logs, and Kibana for visualization.

### 1. **Elasticsearch Setup**

First, ensure that Elasticsearch is installed and running on your machine or server. You can use Docker to run Elasticsearch:

```bash
docker run -d --name elasticsearch -p 9200:9200 -e "discovery.type=single-node" elasticsearch:7.10.0
```

### 2. **Logstash Setup**

Logstash is used to collect, process, and forward logs to Elasticsearch. Create a Logstash configuration file (`logstash.conf`) to define how the logs should be processed. Here's a basic example of a `logstash.conf`:

```plaintext
input {
  beats {
    port => 5044
  }
}

filter {
  json {
    source => "message"
  }
}

output {
  elasticsearch {
    hosts => ["http://localhost:9200"]
    index => "springboot-logs-%{+YYYY.MM.dd}"
  }
  stdout { codec => rubydebug }
}
```

Run Logstash with this configuration:

```bash
docker run -d --name logstash -p 5044:5044 -v /path/to/logstash.conf:/usr/share/logstash/pipeline/logstash.conf logstash:7.10.0
```

### 3. **Kibana Setup**

Kibana is used for visualizing logs stored in Elasticsearch. You can also run Kibana using Docker:

```bash
docker run -d --name kibana -p 5601:5601 --link elasticsearch:kibana elasticsearch:7.10.0
```

### 4. **Spring Boot Application Setup**

In your Spring Boot application, add the required dependencies to `pom.xml` (if you're using Maven):

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>net.logstash.logback</groupId>
    <artifactId>logstash-logback-encoder</artifactId>
    <version>6.6</version>
</dependency>
```

### 5. **Logback Configuration**

To send logs to Logstash, create or modify your `logback-spring.xml` file in the `src/main/resources` directory:

```xml
<configuration>
    <appender name="logstash" class="net.logstash.logback.appender.LogstashTcpSocketAppender">
        <destination>localhost:5044</destination>
        <encoder class="net.logstash.logback.encoder.LogstashEncoder" />
    </appender>

    <root level="INFO">
        <appender-ref ref="logstash" />
    </root>
</configuration>
```

This configuration will direct all logs to Logstash, which in turn forwards them to Elasticsearch.

### 6. **Application Properties**

Configure your `application.properties` or `application.yml` to fine-tune logging:

```properties
# Log Level Configuration
logging.level.root=INFO
logging.level.com.yourpackage=DEBUG
```

### 7. **Testing and Visualization**

After the configuration:

1. Run your Spring Boot application.
2. Logstash will receive the logs and forward them to Elasticsearch.
3. Open Kibana by navigating to `http://localhost:5601` in your browser.
4. Create an index pattern for `springboot-logs-*` to visualize the logs.

### 8. **Advanced Logging**

You can further enhance logging by:

- **Using MDC (Mapped Diagnostic Context)** for contextual logging.
- **Configuring different appenders** for different environments (e.g., file-based logging in development).
- **Setting up custom fields** to include more application-specific details.

### Conclusion

This setup allows you to have a robust logging system using **ELK with Spring Boot**. It gives visibility into your application's behavior, performance, and errors, making it easier to monitor and debug.
